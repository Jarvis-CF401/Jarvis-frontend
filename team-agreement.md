## Conflict Plan:
Team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Talk to the person in regards to conflict.
### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Talk to the person about contributing
### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We will make attempts to share information with each other. Not everyone knows the same exact things and we’re all still learning.
### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
We will reach out to the member first, and if that fails, reach out to our instructor.
### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
We will speak to our instructor.

Work Plan
